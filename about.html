    <h2>About This Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the India Trip Planner! This tool allows you to plan road trips between Indian cities by entering your 
      starting and destination cities. Based on popular routes, we suggest stopovers and highlights along the way, helping 
      you make the most of your journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future upgrades may include features like interactive maps, suggestions for modes of transportation (bus, train, flights), 
      live traffic data, and hotel recommendations along your route.
